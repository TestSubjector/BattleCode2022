# BattleCode2022

Team: **Do Lonely Laboratories Dream of Golden Anomalies?**

We were one of the finalists for BattleCode 2022 and won the special prize by Symbotic for *Most Adaptive Strategy*.  
Postmortem may or may not happen.

Link to our [final submission](https://github.com/TestSubjector/BattleCode2022/tree/main/battlecode22-scaffold/src/AFinalsBot).  
Several of our old bot versions have been shifted to [oldbots](https://github.com/TestSubjector/BattleCode2022/tree/main/battlecode22-scaffold/oldbots) because Gradle was crying otherwise.  

The [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/TestSubjector/BattleCode2022/blob/main/battlecode22-scaffold/CHANGELOG.md) although incomplete gives a timeline of the progress of the bot.

A lot of our pathfinding/miner code is based on the previous BattleCode work of [IvanGeffner](https://github.com/IvanGeffner).  
A lot of our micro/soldier is based on the previous BattleCode work of [TheDuck314](https://github.com/TheDuck314).  
Several important observations are scattered across our commits, abandoned Markdown files and our local match runner script files.
